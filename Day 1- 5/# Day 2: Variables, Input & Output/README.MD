# Day 2: Variables, Input & Output

## ✅ What I Did
- Learned how to declare variables
- Used `input()` to take user input
- Combined `input()` and `print()` for interaction

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Variables store data: `name = "Alice"`
- User input: `age = input("Enter your age: ")`
- Print multiple variables: `print("Hello", name)`

## 🔁 Practice
- Ask user for their name, age, and city. Print a sentence like:
  - `"Hi Alice! You are 21 years old and live in London."`
